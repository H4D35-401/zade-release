## 🚀 Vision
To create a seamless bridge between user intent and system action through advanced voice recognition, neural-link AI (Mistral), and automated task sequences.

## 🖥️ Platform Support
- **Operating System**: Optimized for **Arch Linux** and general Linux distributions.
- **Window Managers**: Fully compatible with Tiling Window Managers (**i3**, **Sway**, **Hyprland**) and Desktop Environments (Knome, Plasma).

## ✨ Key Features
- **Voice Ignition**: Wake the system with simple voice cues (defaulting to "Ignite").
- **Neural Brain**: Integrated with Mistral AI for intelligent, context-aware conversations.
- **Auto-Sequence**: Automatically launch your specific app stack (Chrome, Spotify, IDEs, etc.) on startup.
- **Premium GUI**: A sleek, Orbitron-styled Command Center for real-time configuration and system health monitoring.
- **Adaptive Voice**: Customizable voice identity, tempo, and pitch offsets.
